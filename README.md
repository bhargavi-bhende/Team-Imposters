## Project Overview

Curvetopia is designed to bring order and beauty to the world of 2D curves. The project aims to:

- **Regularize Curves**: Identify regular shapes such as straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, rounded rectangles, polygons, and star shapes from a set of 2D curves.
- **Explore Symmetry**: Detect symmetry in closed shapes, including reflection symmetries and fitting Bezier curves on symmetric points.
- **Complete Incomplete Curves**: Fill gaps in planarized curves where overlapping portions have been removed.

## Tech Stack

Both proposed solutions use the following tech stack:
- **Python**: For algorithm implementation
- **Flask**: For web framework
- **SVGWrite**: For generating SVG files
- **CairoSVG**: For converting SVG to PNG
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Shapely**: For geometric operations

## Solutions

Our team has proposed two solutions/algorithm to the problem each of which has been uploaded in the repo along with their respective readme and demo video links
